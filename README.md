# Hello-World

Hello, World!

RISE here! In terms of coding and CompSci, I'm still a n00b. Went to school for a few years to learn, but I'm not so great with blindly accepting rules for the sake of "going along." Hopefully, if all goes well, we can break some boundaries and create a new world that's suitable for everyone to learn and contribute to!
